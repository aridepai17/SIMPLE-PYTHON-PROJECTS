Main Execution

1.	Import the necessary modules: random and Counter from the collections module.
2. 	Define a string Words containing a list of fruit names.
3.	Split the Words string into a list of words.
4.	Randomly select a word from the Words list and store it in the word variable.
5.	Print a message asking the user to guess the word, which is the name of a fruit.

Game Loop

1.	Initialize the display of the hidden word by printing underscores for each letter in the word.
2.	Initialize the game variables:
		playing: a flag to control the game loop
		letterguessed: a set to store the letters guessed by the user
		chances: the number of chances the user has to guess the word (set to the length of the word plus 2)
		correct: the number of correct letters guessed
		flag: a flag to indicate if the user has won the game
3.	Start the game loop:
		Decrement the chances variable by 1.
		Prompt the user to enter a letter to guess.
		Validate the user's input:
			Ensure the input is a single alphabetic character.
			Check if the user has already guessed the letter.
		If the input is valid, add the letter to the letterguessed set.
		Display the current state of the word, revealing the correctly guessed letters and keeping the remaining letters hidden.
		Check if all the letters in the word have been guessed (i.e., the letterguessed set contains all the letters in the word).
			If all letters have been guessed, print a congratulatory message and set the flag variable to True to exit the game loop.
4.	If the user has run out of chances and the word has not been guessed, print a message indicating that the user has lost and display the correct word.
