1.	Define Constants and Variables
		OPERATORS: List of available operators for arithmetic problems (+, -, *).
		MINOPERAND, MAXOPERAND: Minimum and maximum bounds for operand values.
		TOTALPROBLEMS: Total number of problems the user will solve.
		wrong: Counter for incorrect guesses, initialized to 0.

2.	Generate an Arithmetic Problem
		Function generateproblem():
		Randomly generate two operands (left and right) between MINOPERAND and MAXOPERAND.
		Randomly select an operator from OPERATORS.
		Create a string expression expr from these operands and the operator.
		Use eval(expr) to calculate the correct answer answer.
		Return the expression and the answer.

3.	Prepare the User for the Start
		Prompt the user to press Enter to start.
		Display a line to indicate the beginning of the challenge.

4.	Start the Timer
		Use time.time() to record the start time (starttime).

5.	Loop Through Problems
		Loop (from i = 0 to TOTALPROBLEMS - 1):
			Generate a problem using generateproblem().
			Get the expression (expr) and the correct answer (answer).
			Enter a while loop to prompt the user for their answer.
			While loop:
				Prompt the user with a formatted string that includes the problem number, expression, and asks for the user's guess.
				If the user's guess matches the correct answer (guess == str(answer)), break the loop and move on to the next problem.
				If the guess is incorrect, increment the wrong counter and continue asking for the correct answer.

6.	Stop the Timer
		Record the end time (endtime) using time.time().

7.	Calculate and Display Results
		Calculate the total time (totaltime) as the difference between endtime and starttime. Round to two decimal places.
		Display a message indicating successful completion, along with the total time taken.
