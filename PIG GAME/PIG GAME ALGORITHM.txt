ALGORITHM

1.	Define the Dice Roll Function
		Create a function roll() that generates a random number between 1 and 6 (representing a dice roll).

2.	Get the Number of Players
		Prompt the user to enter the number of players (from 2 to 4).
		If the input is a number and within the valid range, continue. Otherwise, prompt again.

3.	Initialize the Game Parameters
		Define the maxscore as 50, which is the target score to win the game.
		Create a list playerscores to hold the cumulative scores for each player, initialized to zero.

4.	Main Game Loop
		The game loop continues until at least one player reaches or exceeds the maxscore.

5.	Player Turns
		Loop through each player to give them a turn to roll the dice.
		Print a message indicating the start of the player's turn.
		Initialize currentscore to zero to track the score for the current turn.

6.	Player's Roll Loop
		Ask if the player would like to roll the dice (input 'y' to roll).
		If the response is not 'y', add currentscore to the player's total score, print their total score, and end their turn.
		If the response is 'y', roll the dice and check the result.
		If the dice roll is 1, print a message that the turn is over, reset currentscore to zero, update the player's total score with currentscore, and break the loop to end the turn.
		If the dice roll is not 1, add the roll value to currentscore and print the current score for this turn.

7.	Update Player's Total Score
		After each turn, add currentscore to the player's total score in playerscores.
		Print the updated total score for the current player.
		Check if the player's total score has reached or exceeded maxscore. If so, break the game loop to end the game.

8.	Determine the Winner
		After exiting the game loop, find the player with the highest score.
		Announce the winner, displaying the winner's player number and final score.
