Import Libraries:
    Import necessary libraries including TensorFlow and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

Load Dataset:
    Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's Keras API.

Preprocess Data:
    Normalize the images by scaling pixel values to the range 0 to 1.

Build Model:
    Define a Sequential model using Keras.
    Add layers to the model (e.g., convolutional layers, pooling layers, dense layers).

Compile Model:
    Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

Train Model:
    Train the model using the training dataset and validate it using the validation dataset.

Visualize a Sample Image:
    Display a sample image from the training dataset using matplotlib.

Predict Using the Model:
    Use the trained model to make a prediction on the sample image.
    Visualize the model's prediction using a bar chart.

Print the Correct Label:
    Print the correct label of the sample image.
